Bryggesett "strøm" kretskort
-Uses AC power
-220v and 5v

Brewer "control" card
-5v(?) AC power
-8 pins inn and out [VCC - power, GND - ground, SCR - ?, NTC - thermo transistor/temprature sensor, BUZ - buzzer, HT1 - heater 1, HT2 - heater 2, ZER - zero]
-Out of the 8 pin it seems that only 4/6 are critical for the brewer to function. If VCC, GND, NTC and ZER are connected no errors apper. 
-HT1 and HT2 can be controled from the arduino via a relay with AC power.   
-SCR has something to do with set temprature and signals to turn on heater 2 ???? dont realy know. 
-NTC x ohm. What is the curve?
-BUZ makes buzzer noize.
-HT1 pin off = no heating. On ( mA, V) turns on heating.
-HT2 pin off = no heating. 
-ZER if off display error. Kill switch.

Hvis ... så ..
-Hvis tempraturmåleren (on the internal power card) ikke er koblet i, kobler bryggesette seg ut med en feilmelding.
-Pulling out the VCC pin while heating, results in error.
-Pulling out the HT1 pin while heating, truns off heating 1 no error.
-If you pull out ZER, the error alerts. 
-Pulling out BUZ, removed the error sound, no error. 
-Wrong NTC input will result in error.
-Pulling out SCR, no error.
